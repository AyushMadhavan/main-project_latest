# Packaging EagleEye Surveillance

The automated build script `tools/build_exe.py` is configured to create a standalone executable for the EagleEye camera client.

## Build Status

The build process ran successfully (Exit Code 0), but the `EagleEye.exe` file might strongly be missing from the `dist/EagleEye` directory. This is sometimes caused by:
1.  **Antivirus/Windows Defender**: They often proactively delete unsigned `.exe` files generated by PyInstaller. Check your quarantine.
2.  **Permission Issues**: The script might not have had write access.

## Manual Build Instructions

You can try running the build script manually to see detailed output and handle any prompts.

1.  Open Terminal/PowerShell.
2.  Navigate to the project root:
    ```powershell
    cd c:\Users\goutham\Documents\abin
    ```
3.  Run the build script:
    ```powershell
    python tools/build_exe.py
    ```
    *This script automatically handles `pyinstaller` arguments and includes necessary assets.*

## Troubleshooting

If `EagleEye.exe` is still missing:
-   **Check Antivirus**: Temporarily disable real-time protection or add an exclusion for the `dist` folder.
-   **Run PyInstaller Directly**:
    ```powershell
    pyinstaller EagleEye.spec --clean --noconfirm
    ```
-   **Missing DLLs**: If the build complains about missing DLLs (e.g. CUDA), ensure your CUDA toolkit paths are in `%PATH%`.

## Configuration
Once built, the configuration file `settings.yaml` will be located in `dist/EagleEye/settings.yaml`. You can edit this file to change the HQ Server URL or Camera ID without rebuilding.
